    <p>Pelicans are a genus of large water birds comprising the family Pelecanidae. They are characterised by a long
        beak and large throat pouch used for catching prey and draining water from the scooped up contents before
        swallowing. They have predominantly pale plumage, the exceptions being the Brown and Peruvian Pelicans. The
        bills, pouches and bare facial skin of all species become brightly coloured before the breeding season. The
        eight living pelican species have a patchy global distribution, ranging latitudinally from the tropics to the
        temperate zone, though they are absent from interior South America as well as from polar regions and the open
        ocean. Fossil evidence of pelicans dates back at least 30 million years, to the remains of a beak very similar
        to that of modern species recovered from Oligocene strata in France.</p>

    <p>Long thought to be related to frigatebirds, cormorants, tropicbirds, gannets and boobies, pelicans are now known
        instead to be most closely related to the Shoebill and Hamerkop, and are placed in the order Pelecaniformes.
        Ibises, spoonbills and herons are more distant relatives, and have been classified in the same order. Pelicans
        frequent inland and coastal waters where they feed principally on fish, catching them at or near the water
        surface. Gregarious birds, they often hunt cooperatively and breed colonially. Four white-plumaged species tend
        to nest on the ground, and four brown or grey-plumaged species nest mainly in trees.</p>
